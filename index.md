Hi! I am Xiaotong. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University. 

I obtained my Ph.D. (summa cum laude*) from Ruhr University Bochum in 2025, where I was advised by Prof. Setareh Maghsudi. 

My research lies at the intersection of online learning, game theory, and multi-agent systems. I am particularly interested in designing provably efficient algorithms for decision-making in complex, dynamic environments, with applications in IoT and Edge Intelligence.

## Research Interests

My current research centers on the following themes:

* **Online Learning & Bandits** Developing theoretical foundations for online decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on multi-armed bandits (MAB), **contextual bandits**, and anomaly-aware learning in networked environments.

* **Multi-agent Systems & Game Theory** Modeling interactions among autonomous agents using game-theoretical frameworks. I study how to achieve efficient coordination in decentralized systems through learning algorithms.

* **Edge Intelligence & IoT** Applying learning and game-theoretic methods to solve real-world resource allocation and task scheduling problems in IoT and edge computing networks.
